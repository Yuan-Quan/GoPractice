# Utility for Practice

Just a simple command line tool to punch in.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

.NET Core

```bash
yourPackageManagerOrSth -maybeSomeParameter dotnetcoreOrSthElse
```

git

```bash
yourPackageManagerOrSth -maybeSomeParameter git
```

Just install them, you kown how to do it.  
Make sure your git is in PATH(of course)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be: just like compile a .Netcore app

```bash
$ dotnet restore && dotnet build
> some text that shows you started the app
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system: no this feature

### Break down into end to end tests

first test can it run properly:
  
linux

```bash
dotnet gpcli.dll --help
```
  
windows

```bash
gpcli.exe --help
```
  
it should show helps.
### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system:  
Just place the GoPractice.util in the GoPractice folder, everything works on relative path
